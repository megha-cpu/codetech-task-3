**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

**NAME**: MEGHANA ANIPIREDDY

**INTERN ID**: CT06DG2670

**DOMAIN**: MACHINE LEARNING

**DURATION**: 6 WEEEKS

**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH

üìù **Task Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of Task 3 of the internship, focused on building an Image Classification Model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The main objective is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying images into their respective categories and evaluating its performance on unseen data.

This task is a crucial exercise in understanding computer vision using deep learning, especially with CNNs, which have proven to be exceptionally powerful for tasks involving images due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.

üñº **Dataset**
The model is trained and tested on the [insert dataset name here, e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom dataset], which includes images categorized into [insert number] classes. Each image is labeled, enabling the use of supervised learning techniques.

**üß† Model Architecture**
The CNN architecture includes:

Convolutional Layers: Extract spatial features from input images

MaxPooling Layers: Reduce spatial dimensions and control overfitting

Dropout Layers: Add regularization to prevent overfitting

Flatten + Dense Layers: Fully connected layers to output class probabilities

The model was compiled with:

Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy / Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Optimizer: Adam

Metrics: Accuracy

**üî¨ Model Training & Evaluation**
The training pipeline includes:

Data Loading & Preprocessing

Resizing and normalizing image data

Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets

One-hot encoding of labels if required

Model Training

Trained for [insert number] epochs

Monitored training and validation loss/accuracy

Performance Evaluation

Evaluated the model on the test dataset

Calculated classification accuracy and loss

Displayed a confusion matrix and classification report

Visualized model predictions on test images

**üñº Output**
The notebook includes output plots and metrics such as:

Training vs Validation Accuracy and Loss curves

Confusion Matrix

Sample predictions with ground truth vs predicted labels

You can find the output images and evaluation results included in the repository (e.g., model_performance_plot.png, confusion_matrix.png, or prediction samples).

**üìà Results & Insights**
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test set.
Key observations:

The model performed well on [insert class names] but struggled with [insert class names].

Increasing depth and filters improved performance up to a point.

Overfitting was controlled using dropout and data augmentation.

**üìö Conclusion**
This task provided strong practical experience in building CNN models for real-world classification tasks. It reinforced key deep learning concepts, including feature extraction, overfitting handling, and model evaluation.

Moving forward, the model can be enhanced by:

Using deeper architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

Applying transfer learning from pre-trained models

Increasing training data or applying augmentation
